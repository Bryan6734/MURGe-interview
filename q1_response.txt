Q1: What problems do you notice with this approach? If it is not working, why do you think it is not working? Write your response (3-4 sentences max) and save it in a file called `q1_response.txt`.

The main problem with this approach is that the model's action space is not limited/constrained to the set of all actions it can take in a given state (in other words, it might take actions that it cannot "afford" to take, or actions that are not relevant/feasible/permissible). If we instruct the model to drop the knife in the living room, it might incorrectly drop a knife when it is not available in the inventory, or pick up a knife when it is not visible. 

SIDE NOTE: The only part that confuses me is that in the unconstrained model's system prompt provided by env.py, the prompt seems to include both the goal as well as the set of all valid actions (see unconstrained_output.txt). I don't know if this is a mistake, but the model fails in both cases anyways.
